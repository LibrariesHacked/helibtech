synopsis: >-
  Article from the THES about the on-going impact of last year's British Library
  cyber attack on scholarly research. Interesting in the fact that it highlights
  the increasing reliance on digital archives, the negative impact of the
  underfunding of the UK's digital infrastructure and the knock on effect of the
  impact of the attack on procurement of further resources by universities.
