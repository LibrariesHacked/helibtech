title: University libraries must be ‘access brokers’, not knowledge repositories

synopsis: >-
  This interesting thought piece from Liam Bullingham (University of Essex)
  published in the Times Higher Education Supplement argues that in an
  environment where institutions are cutting library budgets and the costs of
  subscriptions and ebooks continues to grow, libraries must reframe their
  offering away from providing an increasing amount of content to that of access
  brokers advising on the best way to access relevant content that may not be
  immediately accessible. This will involve a greater focus on services such as
  interlibrary loans as the cost of, for example, large read and publish deals
  becomes unsustainable.
