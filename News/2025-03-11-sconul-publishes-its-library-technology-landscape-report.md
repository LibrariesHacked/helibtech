synopsis: >-
  SCONUL has published its Library Technology Landscape Report both scoping the
  products and services used in the sector and assessing customer experience of
  performance / service of different products and vendors.


  This will likely prove a useful tool for librarians considering changes to their existing technology architecture and platforms. Note however that the survey was limited to some 96 institutions. For a more comprehensive overview of the products used in the sector, please refer to the [Who Uses What ](https://www.helibtech.com/who-uses-what/)section of HELibTech which includes details of solutions used by over 180 institutions.
