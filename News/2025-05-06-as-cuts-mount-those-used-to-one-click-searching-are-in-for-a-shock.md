title: As cuts mount, those used to one-click searching are in for a shock

synopsis: >-
  In this opinion piece in the Times Higher Education Supplement, university
  librarian Caroline Ball argues that financial pressures on institutions are
  leading them to consider cancellation of "big deals" for bundle packages of
  content with the big five publishers. With further cancellation decisions
  expected from institutions this coming summer, the efficacy of library
  discovery solutions will necessarily be reduced. As such there will be a
  greater role for librarians in assisting academics and students with effective
  free web searching and a greater role for building digital literacy skills.
