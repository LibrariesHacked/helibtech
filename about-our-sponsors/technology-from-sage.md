The ethos of Technology from Sage is to remove barriers to knowledge through a curated suite of library technologies designed to streamline the academic workflow - from managing reading lists to discovering online resources and reference management. Products can be used individually or in combination to both improve the workflows for academics and library staff, and to enable students to discover and manage resources more easily.

 You can find out more about the [Technology from Sage product suite on their website.](https://www.technologyfromsage.com/)

 Technology from Sage products have been designed to address barriers across the academic workflow and improve productivity and efficiency for patrons, with the aim of amplifying the library’s value and impact:

Talis Aspire is an online resource list management system that integrates with library and learning management systems to streamline course resourcing, copyright compliance and acquisitions. It is designed to connect academics and students to library holdings directly within their course resource lists by:

* streamlining resourcing and acquisitions 
* enabling academics to efficiently collate and structure resources lists
* simplifying student access to resources

Recent testimonies for Talis Aspire from the sector:

“Talis Aspire is much more than just reading list software. It brings together
learning resources from a range of sources and embeds them into our Virtual Learning Environment.” –James Hodgkin, Associate Director and University Librarian, University of Gloucestershire, UK

“\[Talis Aspire] provides many of the benefits that are integral to our library service:  innovation, collaboration and is student-centered. It facilitates the collaboration between academics and the library in the development and resourcing of reading lists and will ensure that the library has a full picture of the resources needed for teaching.” – Theresa Thurston, Assistant Director: Resources and Digital Discovery, Library and Learning Resources, Canterbury Christ Church University

“We appreciate that you all actually listen to us when we tell you what we need. Not many vendors do. You all really are my best decision for a software implementation that I have made in my career.” – Elizabeth Speer, Associate Director of Digital Scholarship, University of North Texas Health
Science Center

### Lean Library

Lean Library is designed to embed library content and services directly into users’ online workflows regardless of where they are searching - Google Scholar, PubMed, ChatGPT, or beyond. Through the Lean Library browser extension, Lean Library is designed to surface library resources and Open Access content at users’ point of need with a view to simplifying the research process and enhance access. 

Recent testimonies for Talis Aspire from the sector:

“We’ve used Lean Library for several years and I’m going to be honest – it’s one of my favourite bits of library technology!” – Matthew Hawkes, Academic Librarian, University of East Anglia, UK

“We also promoted Lean Library at staff-facing events—amazingly, one researcher came back to me and said, “This is making my grant writing so much easier!” That really got buy-in because it was somebody recognisable saying, “this is amazing.” – Rebecca Scott, Project Manager, University of Hertfordshire

“Lean Library is an excellent tool and has enhanced the research library experience for our students. Its integration into our Library and the easy extension download provides our user with a powerful time-saver research tool. We highly recommend it to our students and researchers looking to streamline their workflow and quickly connect to the valuable content in our library's collection.” – PJ Purchase, University Librarian and Director of University Library, University of Phoenix
