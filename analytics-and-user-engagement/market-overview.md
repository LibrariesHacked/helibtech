# User engagement - market overview

There are a number of products on the market that provide solutions for some or all of the user engagement functions that libraries seek to carry out.

Typically such user engagement activities may include:

* Log and record user enquiries
* Answer enquiries from users
* Provide information literacy support through guides for resources and information seeking / management topics
* Manage user communications
* Manage users physical use of library space e.g. through room bookings



## Library specific solutions

Many HE libraries are now using library specific software packages to manage some or all of the above functions. More information on enquiry management software solutions can be found in our product directory.

Some libraries will use, non-library specific enquiry management solutions to either record enquiries or to facilitate a live chat service. There are a plethora of such products on the market such as ServiceNow and ZenDesk. In many of these cases they will be using software purchased primarily with a view to managing an IT service desk function and adapted for use by libraries.
