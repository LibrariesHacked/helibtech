[Artificial Intelligence in academic library strategy in the United Kingdom and the Mainland of China. ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0099133323001118)

There is growing recognition of the value of applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) in libraries. This study explores how academic libraries have responded to this opportunity at the level of strategy, what is the status of the application of AI, if any, and what are the different emphases of development comparing the UK and China. The data for the study was strategy documentation from high-ranking universities and their libraries. The sample consisted of the top 25 universities from the United Kingdom and top 25 from the Mainland of China according to the QS world university rankings. Explicit mention of Artificial Intelligence and related technologies is rarely found in strategic plans of universities in the UK but most Chinese universities mention them in their vision statements which focus on the development of new majors and research of the technology. Though several libraries have already implemented applications based on AI or claim to be “smart” or “intelligent” most academic library strategic plans or agendas do not emphasize AI. This is one of the first studies to explore the current status of AI applied in academic libraries as a sector and to compare experiences internationally.

Valid concerns and challenges surround Generative AI, leading to a growing debate on regulation. However, academic libraries cannot overlook its significant potential benefits. With an objective to deliver optimal service to users, libraries are looking at how their trusted vendors and suppliers may use Generative AI to help them achieve this goal.[](https://digital-scholarship.org/ai/ai-libraries.htm)

The Artificial Intelligence and Libraries Bibliography includes over 125 selected English-language articles and books that are useful in understanding how libraries are exploring and adopting modern artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. It covers works from January 2018 through August 2023.[](https://nationalcentreforai.jiscinvolve.org/wp/2023/06/05/library-strategy-and-artificial-intelligence/)

“The probable impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on work, including professional work, is contested, but it is unlikely to leave them untouched. The purpose of this conceptual paper is to consider the likelihood of the adoption of different approaches to AI in academic libraries.”
