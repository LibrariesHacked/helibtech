# Analytics

This site uses an analytics platform called [Umami](https://umami.is/) to track visitor interactions. This is a self-hosted, open-source analytics solution that respects user privacy. It does not use cookies or collect any personal data and anonymises IP addresses.

Given this, there is no reason why we should see the data and you shouldn't. You can view the [HELibTech anlytics dashboard](https://analytics.librarydata.uk/share/eEamE3zKi9pdLRoV/www.helibtech.com).
