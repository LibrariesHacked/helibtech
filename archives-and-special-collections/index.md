# Archives and special collections

Archive management systems are functionally similar to both library management systems and records management systems but have been developed to tailor to the unique needs of museums and galleries for managing the broad range of objects, artefacts and documents that they conserve.

In terms of functionality, archive systems are designed to:

* Catalogue artefacts to metadata standards
* Enable discoverability of collections
* Manage the location of collections

In these respects we can see the functional similarity with library management systems. However, archive systems will typically offer additional functionality:

* Assessment of materials â€“ both qualitatively and quantitatively i.e. details about a number of linked objects and their condition
* Additional provenance information about the source of collected items
* Object records capable of describing multiple linked objects with a broad array of content descriptors
* Some systems will also provide functionality to ingest digital records to enable public discovery of digitised objects. Others will provide the functionality to create records for digitalobjects stored elsewhere.
