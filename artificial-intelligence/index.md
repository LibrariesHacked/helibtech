### EBSCO

EBSCO Information Services Introduces Artificial Intelligence Beta Program ([press release June 18, 2024](https://www.ebsco.com/news-center/press-releases/ebsco-information-services-introduces-artificial-intelligence-beta-program)) 

*"EBSCO is launching artificial intelligence (AI) beta programs to partner with customers and receive user input on the company’s AI efforts. The first beta test concluded in May 2024, and a second beta will begin in July 2024. The betas are intended to create efficiencies for researchers working within [EBSCO Discovery Service](https://www.ebsco.com/products/ebsco-discovery-service)™ (EDS) and[ EBSCOhost](https://www.ebsco.com/products/ebscohost-research-platform)®. Beta testers are exploring two features — AI Insights, which will generate a short list of insights from full-text articles, and Natural Language Search, which allows researchers to conduct search in their natural language, with user queries honored as questions in search. EBSCO’s AI Insights feature generates on-demand, high-level summary statements, or “insights” from full-text articles so researchers can quickly assess the relevancy of an article for their research topic. The insights are generated using a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) method, where the AI is grounded on the full text to reduce hallucinations. Extensive variations of responses were verified by EBSCO librarians, customers, and end users via human-in-the-loop processes. During the beta testing period, customers were asked if the AI Insight was useful, and 90 percent of participants confirmed it was beneficial. EBSCO will be sharing results of this beta in July 2024."*

## Metadata

### Clarivate/Ex Libris

**The AI Metadata Assistant** 

*"The Alma AI Metadata Assistant streamlines cataloging by suggesting metadata for bibliographic records, which catalogers can review, refine, or dismiss. Using AI-driven insights from Large Language Models (LLMs) and vision-based tools, it makes cataloging faster and more accurate, allowing experts to focus on higher-level tasks. The AI Metadata Generator enriches bibliographic records in the Alma Community Zone. Currently enriching ProQuest™ Ebook Central titles, it aims to improve 100,000 records by the end of 2024, saving time and reducing costs for content providers while ensuring high-quality metadata for libraries."* [Harnessing Academic AI – Insights from Clarivate](https://exlibrisgroup.com/announcement/latest-news-harnessing-academic-ai-insights-from-clarivate/)

[The AI Metadata Assistant in the Metadata Editor ](https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Alma/Product_Documentation/010Alma_Online_Help_(English)/Metadata_Management/005Introduction_to_Metadata_Management/The_AI_Metadata_Assistant_in_the_Metadata_Editor)[](https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Alma/Product_Documentation/010Alma_Online_Help_(English)/Metadata_Management/005Introduction_to_Metadata_Management/The_AI_Metadata_Assistant_in_the_Metadata_Editor)

 *"What is the AI Metadata Assistant? The AI Metadata Assistant uses a Large Language Model generative AI to process information about a library resource and suggest relevant metadata to the cataloger to help make the cataloging process quicker and more efficient. The cataloger can then review the suggested data and accept, correct or dismiss it, as well as add more complex, expert metadata and library-specific metadata. The AI Metadata Assistant can process images of a library resource along with other provided information, extract the text and meaning, and return it structured according to cataloging standards. It can be used for creating new bibliographic records, as well as enriching existing brief records. Phase Iof Alma’s AI Metadata Assistant supports creating and enriching MARC 21records in the English language – more cataloging and resource languages and formats will be added in future phases, as we work with the community to evaluate the AI’s capabilities and quality of metadata. The subjects provided are validated against Library of Congress vocabularies, with plans to increase the selection of authority vocabularies in future phases.*

(from UCL LibGuide) https://library-guides.ucl.ac.uk/generative-ai/genai-search-tools

*"Scite is a wide-ranging AI-supported tool. Its core feature is identifying and classifying citations based on whether the text surrounding them supports the cited work, is in contrast to it, or merely mentions it in passing. This allows it to factor this into citation-based searches and metrics, in a way that is not possible with most citation databases and may mean you get more relevant and useful results. Scite also offers an AI "search assistant", which tries to generate an answer to a question with citations to supporting literature. This is generally of good quality, and it is good for a summary overview, but should be treated with caution - it may have omissions and inaccuracies, and we would not recommend using it as your only search method. AI assistant tools like this often select the papers to highlight in a very idiosyncratic way and may miss key papers."*

##  Understanding AI

To understand where AI should be used and will be most successful, one must understand what AI really is. AI, or machine learning, refers to a broad set of algorithms that can solve a specific set of problems, if trained properly.

The success of artificial intelligence depends on data.

The AI bucket consists of:

* Big data
* Analytics
* Machine learning
* Natural language processing
* Data visualisation
* Decision logic

## Common AI terms

Taken from:

AI in the UK: ready, willing and able? HOUSE OF LORDS Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence. Report of Session 2017–19 HL Paper 100 16 April 2018.

### Algorithm

A series of instructions for performing a calculation or solving a problem, especially with a computer. They form the basis for everything a computer can do, and are therefore a fundamental aspect of all AI systems.

### Expert system

A computer system that mimics the decision-making ability of a human expert by following pre-programmed rules, such as ‘if this occurs, then do that’. These systems fuelled much of the earlier excitement surrounding AI in the 1980s, but have since become less fashionable, particularly with the rise of neural networks.

### Machine learning

One particular form of AI, which gives computers the ability to learn from and improve with experience, without being explicitly programmed. When provided with sufficient data, a machine learning algorithm can learn to make predictions or solve problems, such as identifying objects in pictures or winning at particular games, for example.

### Neural network

Also known as an artificial neural network, this is a type of machine learning loosely inspired by the structure of the human brain. A neural network is composed of simple processing nodes, or ‘artificial neurons’, which are connected to one another in layers. Each node will receive data from several nodes ‘above ’it, and give data to several nodes ‘below’ it. Nodes attach a ‘weight’ to the data they receive, and attribute a value to that data. If the data does not pass a certain threshold, it is not passed on to another node. The weights and thresholds of the nodes are adjusted when the algorithm is trained until similar data input results in consistent outputs.

### Deep learning

A more recent variation of neural networks, which uses many layers of artificial neurons to solve more difficult problems. Its popularity as a technique increased significantly from the mid-2000s onwards, as it is behind much of the wider interest in AI today. It is often used to classify information from images, text or sound
