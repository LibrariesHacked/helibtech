# Artificial intelligence: useful resources

Below is a collection of useful reports, websites, blogposts etc. relevant to different aspects of artificial intelligence:

### **[Generative Artificial Intelligence and Web-Scale Discovery](https://niso.org/publications/odi-ai-survey-report)**. 

A report from the NISO Open Discovery Initiative Standing Committee. Ken Varnum, University of Michigan; Rachel Kessler, Clarivate, Judy Zhu, IEEE; Teresa Hazen, University of Arizona; Bobbi Patham, Springer Nature; Jay Holloway, OCLC. NISO August 2025. 

Key findings of the survey include:

Library and Content Provider respondents shared common hopes about Generative AI in discovery. Their mutual top three choices were:

Improved visibility of content; More accurate content recommendations; and Saving staff time

There was less uniformity among fears, with each cohort responding in ways that were more closely aligned with their interests. Interestingly both cohorts ranked “lack of transparency about inputs” in their top three, though presumably for different reasons.

Library respondents’ top three fears were: 

1.  Misrepresentation or fabrication of content; 
2. Lack of transparency about inputs
3.  Quality of AI-generated summaries

Content Provider respondents’ top three fears were: 

1. Copyright infringement
2. Misrepresentation or fabrication of content 
3.  Lack of transparency about inputs.

 Library respondents generally felt that Generative AI tools would enhance the value of web scale discovery for users and staff, though not overwhelmingly so.

Content Provider respondents expressed hope that Generative AI would, in most cases, improve the visibility of their own content, while being less positive about the effect on access to it.

Library respondents, in particular, expressed concern about the potential environmental risks posed by the data centers needed to create Generative AI models and process queries.

### Uses for AI in the library (excluding) student information skills.

Post on the AIED@JISCMAIL.AC.UK Listserve. Monday 14 April 2025. Tracey Totty Library Services Manager. Middlesbrough College Group. t.totty@mbro.ac.uk 

I recently asked what library staff would use AI for, that isn’t supporting student information skills.

### Generative AI and the  future of library services

Opportunities and challenges in a changing technology environment.  Clarivate white paper. March 2024

From the paper
"According to the 2024 Pulse of the Library report, over 60% of libraries are evaluating or planning for artificial intelligence integration, with 43% prioritizing AI-powered tools for patrons in the coming year. Key objectives include supporting student learning (52%), promoting research excellence (47%), and enhancing content discoverability (45%).

Despite this enthusiasm, librarians report significant hurdles. About 47% of respondents identified shrinking budgets as a primary concern, while 52% pointed to a skills gap, noting the need for upskilling in AI competencies. Additionally, 32% reported a lack of available training opportunities. These challenges emphasize the need for strategic planning and collaboration within the library community to effectively implement AI solutions.

The consensus is that, for the foreseeable future, humans and AI will work in tandem to boost productivity, enhance decision-making, and drive innovation. In library environments, this partnership is already evident, with AI assisting in tasks such as resource discovery, metadata management, and personalized learning support while librarians provide critical oversight, ethical guidance and domain expertise. The stakes are high for libraries. They are trusted sources of knowledge, offering access to high-quality, scholarly, and scientific data. That trust has been built over hundreds of years of standards that outline meticulous selection and indexing of collections, ensuring users engage with authoritative and reliable academic resources. To maintain that trust, libraries must harness AI’s power responsibly. This involves not only adopting AI tools but also actively shaping how they are used, ensuring they align with core values of accuracy, inclusivity and academic integrity.

[Artificial Intelligence in academic library strategy in the United Kingdom and the Mainland of China. ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0099133323001118)

[](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0099133323001118)Yingshen Huang a, Andrew M. Cox b, John Cox C. The Journal of Academic Librarianship Volume 49, Issue 6, November 2023.

There is growing recognition of the value of applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) in libraries. This study explores how academic libraries have responded to this opportunity at the level of strategy, what is the status of the application of AI, if any, and what are the different emphases of development comparing the UK and China. The data for the study was strategy documentation from high-ranking universities and their libraries. The sample consisted of the top 25 universities from the United Kingdom and top 25 from the Mainland of China according to the QS world university rankings. Explicit mention of Artificial Intelligence and related technologies is rarely found in strategic plans of universities in the UK but most Chinese universities mention them in their vision statements which focus on the development of new majors and research of the technology. Though several libraries have already implemented applications based on AI or claim to be “smart” or “intelligent” most academic library strategic plans or agendas do not emphasize AI. This is one of the first studies to explore the current status of AI applied in academic libraries as a sector and to compare experiences internationally.

### [The impact of Generative AI on libraries? ](https://clarivate.com/lp/the-impact-of-generative-ai-on-libraries/)

Valid concerns and challenges surround Generative AI, leading to a growing debate on regulation. However, academic libraries cannot overlook its significant potential benefits. With an objective to deliver optimal service to users, libraries are looking at how their trusted vendors and suppliers may use Generative AI to help them achieve this goal.[](https://digital-scholarship.org/ai/ai-libraries.htm)
