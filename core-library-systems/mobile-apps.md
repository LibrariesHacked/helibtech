# Mobile apps

In order to offer library system functionality on a mobile device (tablet or phone) vendors may offer a 'responsive design' approach. In essence this resizes the existing web based functionality to fit on a smaller (mobile or tablet) screen. Vendors may also offer Apps. In general Apps have to be downloaded (from an 'app store' - e.g. Apple's app store, or Google Play) onto the mobile device and generally provide a different user experience. For example, workflows and functions may be tailored to better exploit working on a mobile device. Apps are available for end users and also library staff. Overall the ‘app’ approach is gaining ground.

Not all ‘apps’ work in this way. Ex Libris has developed a ‘Cloud Apps framework’ that enables non–Ex Libris programmers to create applications that run within the Alma platform, enabling libraries to add features without the source code. To date, developers have made 57 Alma Cloud Apps that have been activated for more than 7,000 staff accounts across nearly 1,000 institutions. .

Apps may be specific to the library or library functionality may be incorporated into a wider university app. For example, Ex Libris provides campusM - an app that is designed for multiple functions. In March 2023, SOLUS well known for their mobile app in public libraries entered the US academic market with a debut at the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) conference in Pittsburgh. SOLUS currently has approximately 20 academic customers in Australia, UK and USA.
