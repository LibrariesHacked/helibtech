# Shared library systems

Whilst in some other library sectors such as the NHS, the practice of multiple library services using a shared library management system is well established, there are limited examples of shared systems within UK higher education.

## WHELF consortium

The most significant example of a shared library system in UK HE is the WHELF consortium in Wales. WHELF signed a contract for the ExLibris Alma solution in December 2014. This followed from the Welsh Shared Service Library Management System Feasibility Report. Jisc February 2013.The Project outputs were:

- A set of high-level agreed consortia requirements for a shared LMS.
- A proposed governance model for the consortium.
- High level recommendations on integration requirements for local systems; map communications standards which are applicable to the project against standards in use by suppliers.
- A business case for a Wales-wide consortia LMS, including cost matrices for the different approaches presented.
- Recommendations on the most cost-effective approach for software, hosting and ongoing management of the LMS.
- A road-map and timelines for potential implementation.

By August 2016 all nine universities in Wales, together with the National Library of Wales and all National Health Service libraries in Wales, were using the same cloud-hosted library management system and discovery layer, Ex Libris/Clarivate Alma and Primo.

The WHELF (Wales Higher Education Forum) Shared LMS project consists of eleven members:

- Aberystwyth University
- Bangor University
- Cardiff Metropolitan University
- Cardiff University, including Welsh NHS Libraries
- Glyndwr University
- National Library of Wales
- Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama
- Swansea University
- University of South Wales
- University of Wales Trinity Saint David

These eleven institutions, spread across nearly ninety library locations, have around 600 library staff, 170,000 customers and approximately ten million bibliographic records.
