# Discovery systems

In UK Higher Education the online catalogue (OPAC) of the library system has been largely replaced by discovery services. These link to the print collection and index electronic resources (typically journal articles). As well as the library catalogue a discovery service may 'harvest' (usually by the OAI-PMH) metadata from other repositories. Discovery services solutions are made up of:

- A central index of electronic resources (subscription and open access)
- A knowledge base which defines what resources (including the components of a 'package' or resources) are subscribed to by the library
- A link (usually OpenURL) resolver to enable the authenticated an authorised library user to access subscribed resources without hitting a paywall

### Who uses what discovery system
