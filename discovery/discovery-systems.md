# Discovery systems

In UK Higher Education the online catalogue (OPAC) of the library system has been largely replaced by discovery services. These link to the print collection and index electronic resources (typically journal articles). As well as the library catalogue a discovery service may 'harvest' (usually by the OAI-PMH) metadata from other repositories. Discovery services solutions are made up of:

* A central index of electronic resources (subscription and open access)
* A knowledge base which defines what resources (including the components of a 'package' or resources) are subscribed to by the library
* A link (usually OpenURL) resolver to enable the authenticated an authorised library user to access subscribed resources without hitting a paywall

  "*Over the past fifteen years, most academic librarians have implemented one-stop search tools, commonly referred to as discovery layers, to accommodate contemporary user expectations. In more recent years these tools have come under criticism due to their limitations and shortcomings. We set out to evaluate if a discovery layer, when prompted with typical user keyword search strings, produced the most relevant search results when compared with two other widely accessible academic search tools. We compared search results from a discovery layer with a central index (WorldCat Discovery) with search results from a subscription interdisciplinary index and abstract database (Academic Search Complete) and a freely accessible academic web search engine (Google Scholar)."*
