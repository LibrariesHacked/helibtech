#### Preamble

In 2024 I attended the International Group of Ex Libris customers (IGeLU) conference and a short while after I attended the World Open Library Foundation Conference (WOLFCon). They both helped me reflect on the nature of open library systems/platforms. It was interesting to note that Ebsco the major funder of the open source Folio library system attended IGeLU and Clarivate (home of Ex Libris) attended WOLFCon.

#### Introduction

The definition of ‘open’ library systems has evolved over time. In the early 1990s a library system vendor advocated ‘open systems’ based largely on its use of the UNIX operating system. This gave libraries ‘more choice’, notably in terms of the minicomputer of which the library system would run on. A decade or so ago open-source software became a defining factor in how many librarians perceived open library systems. The divide between open-source and propriety library software approaches was seen as a ‘battle’ between opposing ideologies. The market has moved on and a more pragmatic approach to library technology solutions is warranted.

#### Platforms

Open source and proprietary are different ways to develop software and each has its pros and cons. The reality is that nowadays large scale solutions are not based wholly on either open source or proprietary software. More significant than arguments about the relative value of open and proprietary approaches to software is the rise of cloud based software ‘platforms’ which have come to dominate many sectors. Open source and proprietary solutions are typically hosted in the cloud on services like (proprietary) Amazon Web Services (AWS). As services move to the cloud the underlying technology becomes of less concern and the focus is on the functional and practical benefits an open library platform can deliver.

#### Open Library Platforms

Librarians are key stakeholders in terms of purchasing library technology. They typically

define needs and set out requirements. Nowadays those requirements will define a broad

‘ecosystem’ - an open library platform - rather than a singular library system. Library

platforms may be characterised as open source (like FOLIO and Koha) or proprietary (like Ex

Libris Alma/Primo and OCLC WMS) but they all embrace open-source components and

combine them with proprietary solutions. For example, a proprietary solution from Ex Libris

will run in the cloud on an open-source operating system and will use other open-source

components such as Elasticsearch. An open-source solution such as FOLIO or Koha will

typically be implemented with a proprietary discovery service such as EBSCO’s EDS or Ex

Libris Summon. If the library needs a reading/resource list solution to integrate with its

open-source library system its only option is to buy a proprietary solution such as Aspire or

KeyLinks. This combination of ‘internal’ built-in functionality and ‘external’ interoperability

provides libraries with a potentially rich ecosystem.
