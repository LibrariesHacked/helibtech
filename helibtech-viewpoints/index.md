This new section on HELibTech will offer thought pieces on issues pertinent to the use of technology within Higher Education libraries. These are not intended to be authoritative sources of information or academic papers. Rather these opinion pieces are there to encourage debate and discussion from within and across the community - both librarians / information professionals and suppliers.

If you would like to contribute an HELibTech viewpoint [get in touch](paulverlander@gmail.com)

### [Can a proprietary library system/platform be more open that an open source one?](https://www.helibtech.com/helibtech-viewpoints/can-a-proprietary-library-system-platform-be-more-open-than-an-open-source-one)

Ken Chad

In the first of our HELibTech Viewpoints, library technology consultant Ken Chad reflects on the current state of the library systems market and argues that notions of open source versus proprietary software when it comes to choices about systems are increasingly outdated and unhelpful. Now that libraries rely on LSPs, these are by their nature a mix of open source and proprietary elements. Therefore the key considerations for pragmatic librarians will be sustainability and development, interoperability and community.[](paulverlander@gmail.com)
