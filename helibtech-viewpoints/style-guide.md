## Style Guide

HELibTech Viewpoints are designed to be relatively concise thought / opinion pieces to prompt discussion or users further investigation on issues relevant to the use of technology in libraries.

Viewpoints can therefore be submitted on any topic within this broad field but we ask submitters to bear in mind the following style guidelines:

* Viewpoints should be approximately 500-1000 words in length
  and use of sub-headings is encouraged.
* Viewpoints are opinion pieces and so references are not required. However, unsubstantiated claims should not be made and it is good practice to link to evidence where appropriate.
* Although critical opinions are encouraged please be respectful of others in the community.
* HELibTech will retain editorial control over Viewpoints but will liaise with authors and not edit submissions without discussing with authors.
* All HELibTech Viewpoints will be clearly attributed to
  authors but will be licensed on a [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) licence, the most open Creative Commons Licence. Find out more about what re-use permissions are granted with this [here.](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
