title: "Rethinking Student Engagement with Library Resources: Collaboration,
  Annotation, and the Librarian's Role"

  ### 3rd July, 3pm 


  Data from Librarian Futures Part II found that just 25% of students reported that librarians supported them in key areas including: thinking critically about the subject and finding good information. Many students still turn to Google to search for resources, finding library systems confusing and disconnected from their courses. Whilst many students trust librarians, there are still critical gaps and opportunities for librarians to play a deeper role in improving student workflows and facilitating student engagement with course materials.


  To explore these issues, join Ken Chad in conversation with Georgia Hajipieris, Product Manager for Talis at Technology from Sage and a librarian as we examine how educators can bring reading, annotation, and collaboration directly into course reading lists. We will hear from a library perspective on increasing collaboration in the classroom, sparking discussions and techniques to ensure reading lists go one step further with engagement. This is all while improving resource discoverability and decreasing the library's cost per use for resources. Finally, we'll discuss how to close the disconnect gap between the student and the library, with students feeling more connected to their course materials, adding value to the library as the heart of teaching and learning.
