title: "Rethinking Student Engagement with Library Resources: Collaboration,
  Annotation, and the Librarian's Role"
date: 2025-07-03T15:00:00.000Z
synopsis: >-
  ###### The most recent HELibTech webinar tookplace on 3rd July


  Data from Librarian Futures Part II found that just 25% of students

  reported that librarians supported them in key areas. While many

  students trust librarians, there are still critical gaps and

  opportunities for librarians to play a deeper role in improving student

  workflows and facilitating student engagement with course materials. To

  explore these issues Ken Chad was in conversation with Georgia

  Hajipieris, Product Manager for Talis and Matthew Weldon, Library Patron

  Consultant (both at Technology from Sage) to examine how educators can

  bring reading, annotation, and collaboration directly into course

  reading lists.
