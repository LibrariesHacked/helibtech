title: A new age for library metadata?
date: 2023-09-27T13:19:00.000Z
synopsis: >-
  Catalogue records remain at the heart of the library technology ecosystem.
  Metadata are critical to making library resources discoverable. Poor metadata
  results in wasted resources, missed opportunities, and builds error into any
  system. Creating quality records can be time consuming and expensive and
  libraries are increasingly looking for more efficient and effective
  approaches. How should academic libraries respond to this new environment? To
  explore the issues, library consultant Ken Chad is in conversation with Lesley
  Whyte, Managing Director of Bibliographic Data Services. BDS has a long record
  of providing metadata services to academic and public libraries, the British
  Library and library suppliers.
