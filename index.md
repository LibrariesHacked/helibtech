# Higher Education Library Technology

![Higher Education Library Technology Logo](/assets/images/helibtech-logo.png)

The aim of HELibTech is to provide a starting point for anyone interested in library technology in Higher Education. The focus is UK but most of the issues will be relevant elsewhere. Content on this wiki (though not external content) is open access, public domain ([CC0 licensed](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)) so feel free to use and re-purpose it.

HELibTech originated in a major sector project: The [JISC & SCONUL Library Management Systems Study](http://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20140615073047/http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/programmes/resourcediscovery/lmsstudy.pdf): An evaluation and horizon scan of the current library management systems and related systems landscape for UK Higher Education. March 2008. HELibTech has enabled the work of that project to be kept up to date and expanded. The site uses the DokuWiki software.

[Ken Chad Consulting](http://www.kenchadconsulting.com/) set up the site and has taken on the role of 'WikiMaster' to encourage contributions, help contributors and protect the site from any malicious activity. However Ken Chad Consulting is not responsible for the content. Anyone can view and download the content (though bear in mind that content that we link to may have restrictions). Feel free to correct, add or edit content. Please keep content neutral and factual and avoid hype. Links can be make to external content.

## UKSG 2023 Innovation award winner

The award will be used to provide an innovative “re-boot” to HELibTech and provide a much-enhanced open resource of accurate data about systems and technologies deployed by libraries in UK HE institutions.

Ken Chad Consulting and PTFS-Europe have collaborated to offer a bursary for a [community editor for Higher Education Library Technology](https://www.helibtech.com/_media/helibtech_community_editor_pr_september_2023.pdf).
