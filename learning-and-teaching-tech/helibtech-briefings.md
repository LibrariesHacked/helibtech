# HELibTech briefings

#### [The rise of library centric reading list systems](https://www.kenchadconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Rise_of_library_centric-_readlinglists_July2018.pdf)

Higher Education Library Technology (HELibTech) Briefing Paper no.5 . July 2018

The last five years have seen a sizable increase in the number of universities in the UK, Australia and New Zealand deploying library centric reading lists solutions. A notable change in the last year or so is that library resource list solutions are beginning to be adopted in the US. The paper suggests that reading/resource list systems will have a major impact on the global library technology market just as library ‘discovery services’ did over a decade ago.

The paper analyses the impact of reading list solutions on students, academics/faculty, the library and the library supply chain. It looks to future developments including the more extensive use of analytics and the increasing role of reading lists in pedagogical ‘scaffolding’.

#### [The student consumer and the rise of e-textbook platforms](https://www.kenchadconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Student_consumer_and_e-textbook_platforms_March2018.pdf)

Higher Education Library Technology (HELibTech) briefing paper (No. 4). March 2018.

A recent report for the Society of College, National & University Libraries (SCONUL) listed ‘students as customers’ as one of the five top 'transformational’ trends that will impact libraries over the next ten years. These student consumers are not all happy and one reason is the rising cost of textbooks and the lack of availability from libraries. The briefing paper looks at the textbook market and moves to digital and more interactive learning. It analyses new approaches to textbook publication and the new ways libraries are delivering e-textbooks to students including the rise of e-textbook platforms, Open Textbooks and institutional initiatives to combat rising textbook costs. It concludes with an analysis of the potential disruptive impact of new user focused e-textbook platforms

#### [The new role of the library in teaching and learning outcomes](https://www.kenchadconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Library_and_teaching_learning_outcomes_June2017_2a-1.pdf)

By Ken Chad & Helen Anderson. HELIbTech briefing paper No. 3. 20 June 2017

Students in many countries, especially the US and UK are concerned that the growing cost of higher education is not delivering good value. Excellence in teaching and a focus on measurement and assessment of learning outcomes have become entrenched in higher education policy and the strategies of academic institutions. In the UK this trend has crystallised in a new Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) introduced by government in 2017.

As a result library leaders around the world will need to become more strategic in articulating value propositions based around a more holistic view of library/learning resources.The value of data analytics will be a key driving force. Data from reading list systems and digital textbook platforms combined with information from other institutional systems will allow powerful insights to emerge. Such analytics will be invaluable to institutions, publishers and intermediaries as they look at new ways to deliver content.

All this suggests a trend for library technology and educational technology to merge. There looks to be the beginning of shift away from a narrow conception of \*library\* systems, the \*library\* supply chain and \*library data\*. Conventional integrated library systems (ILS) and even the new generation of library services platforms (LSPs) remain wedded to an outdated view of library learning resources and will have to change significantly or be integrated or subsumed into a new generation of learning services platforms.

#### [Teaching and learning outcomes, the TEF (Teaching Excellence Framework) a new world for libraries, publishers and intermediaries](https://www.kenchadconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ken-Chad_Teaching_learning_outcomes_UKSG_April2018.pdf)

Presentation at UKSG Conference . April 2018

A focus on measurement and assessment of teaching and learning outcomes has become entrenched in policy and the strategies of academic institutions. In the UK this trend has crystallised in the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF). Librarians are increasingly managing course specific resources that up to now had been the province of the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) or digital textbook platforms. This session looks at the impacts on content and licensing, e-textbooks and the potential merging of library and educational technology.
