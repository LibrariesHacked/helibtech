## Digitisation solution market share 2024

The below market overview refers specifically to solutions for managing the workflows around digitising published content for distribution to students as part of learning and teaching. Such software is based around ensuring compliance with the Copyright Licensing Agency Higher Education licence which is used by UK HEIs to allow copying and distribution of published works for use in learning and teaching.

Many of the institutions not using such software will be using manual workflows for managing licence compliance and will be adding digitised content direct to virtual learning environments.
