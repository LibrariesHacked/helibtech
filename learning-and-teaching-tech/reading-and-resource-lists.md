# Reading and resource lists

## What are reading List/resource List solutions?

These are essentially 'curation' tools. Academics (with the help of librarians) create online resource lists - commonly by module or course. There is usually flexibility to create lists in a number of different formats e.g. by topic or by week of study. Resources may be further categorized by priority such as 'essential' or background' reading. 

Resource list solutions offer direct integration with library mangement systems and discovery solutions.

Online resource lists will contain direct links to content (in the case of digital content such as journal articles, ebooks, ebook chapters, web pages etc.). In the case of print materials they will usually direct link to a library catalogue showing current holdings and availability.

In this respect, online resource lists are perceived to challenge the traditional learning method of self-discovery of resources as they lead students directly to specific content to support their learning.

In the UK and other countries such as Australia and New Zealand older 'course reserve' modules have almost entirely replaced by more comprehensive Reading List solutions such as Talis Aspire, Ex Libris Leganto or Kortext Keylinks. Reading list solutions are increasingly adopted in the US and worldwide.

In addition Blackwell offer a service that enables lecturers and others to submit reading list details and as a result enable ordering of books on the list from Blackwell - [Readinglists.co.uk](https://blackwells.co.uk/rsl/index.dfp)

However, this is not a reading list solution as per the others listed above, rather a reading list specific acquisitions workflow.
