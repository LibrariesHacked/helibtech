# Digitisation

This section of HELibTech covers the technology HE libraries use to digitise published works and distribute them to students, typically either via reading list software or via a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE)

## Digitisation for learning & teaching and UK copyright

The ability to mass-distribute copyright works to students (either digitally or in print) is not permissible under library relevant exceptions to UK Copyright Law. However, the need to distribute extracts of published works to students for learning and teaching purposes is facilitated by the [Copyright Licensing Agency’s (CLA) Higher Education Licence](https://cla.co.uk/cla-products/higher-education-licence/).

The licence allows digital distribution of extracts of published works (either from scanned print or digital born holdings) under certain conditions based on:

- extent limits
- copying from participating publishers in participating territories
- data recording and reporting on copying to the CLA
- not systematically copying extracts in such a way as to supplant the need for students to purchase a textbook (known as textbook substitution under the terms of the licence)

Institutions can also distribute published works outside of their holdings through purchase of a copyright fee paid copy of an article / extract for example via the British Library.

## Workflow management software

Whilst not a requirement of the CLA licence, increasingly institutions are using dedicated digitisation / copyright workflow management software both to streamline digitisation processes and to meet the recording / reporting requirements of their CLA licence.

### CLA Digital Content Store (DCS)

Access to the [CLA’s Digital Content Store](https://www.cla.co.uk/resources/tools/digital-content-store/?_gl=1*7yz7ru*_gcl_au*MTY2NzcxMjE3MC4xNzIzMDI3MjQ3) is offered to HEIs as an add-on to the Higher Education Copyright Licence. DCS offers an online workflow management solution allowing library staff to:

- check extract permissions
- record data on their copying (through integration with an institution’s course / module /student data)
- upload copies to an online repository
- online ordering of copyright fee paid copies through integration with the British Library’s Enhanced Higher Education Supply Service (EHESS)
- access a shared repository of digitised copies of extracts uploaded from across the DCS community

Integration with reading list management solutions such as Leganto and Keylinks can be facilitated via API.

### Talis Aspire Copyright Clearance

[Talis Aspire Copyright Clearance](https://support.talis.com/hc/en-gb/sections/17477713377309-Talis-Aspire-Copyright-Clearance) (formerly Talis Aspire Digitised Content – TADC), similarly, is a digitisation and copyright workflow management tool. Offered as an optional add-on subscription to the Talis Aspire reading list software, Talis Aspire Copyright Clearance:

- checks extract permissions against the CLA Check Permissions API
- report on copying for compliance with the CLA licence
- allow academics to make digitisation requests via their Aspire reading list for processing by library staff
- host digitised content securely which can then be accessed via the Aspire reading list

Talis Aspire Copyright Clearance is therefore intrinsically linked to the Aspire reading list platform and is integrated into the Aspire workflow. As such, whilst offering a seamless workflow to Aspire users it is not compatible with any other reading list solution.

## Accessible copies for print disabilities

The [RNIB Bookshare](https://www.rnib.org.uk/living-with-sight-loss/independent-living/reading-and-books/rnib-bookshare/) service provides access to accessible versions of academic texts to library users who may be considered to be print disabled learners under UK legislation.

The service is not just accessible to those with a visual impairment and there are a range of users with specific learning needs who may be considered print disabled and eligible to access the service.

Bookshare offers an extensive database of books and other learning materials in a range of accessible formats including:

- Daisy audio
- MP3
- Braille (BRF)
- Epub
- PDF
- Word

Many HE libraries now host organisational accounts with Bookshare and are able to allocate individual user accounts to eligible students.
