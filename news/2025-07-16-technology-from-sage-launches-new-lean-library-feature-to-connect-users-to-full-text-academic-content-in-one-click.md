synopsis: >-
  Technology from Sage has launched a new feature on Lean Library: One-Click to
  PDF. This feature allows seamless access to full-text PDFs or HTML equivalents
  of academic content via a library's discovery layer.  


  Previously, Lean Library saved users up to three minutes per search by streamlining authenticationn and access through its browser extension. The new feature, integrated with GetFTR, speeds up access to scholarly content and drives library resource usage. Users can now benefit from streamlined access even without the browser extension.


  The One-Click to PDF feature is now available for all customers, and further developments are expected later this year.
