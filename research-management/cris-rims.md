# CRIS / RIMS

The terms CRIS - current research information system and RIMS - research information management system, are largely used interchangeably within the market and you will see both terms used across the sector. 

These are software solutions which are designed to manage the full research lifecycle and work of individual researchers from project inception, funding due to publication and subsequent impact. 

The benefit of a CRIS / RIMS is to ensure that all information related to an institution's researchers and research outputs is available and accessible in one place. This has advantages both from an internal administration point of view particularly when meeting the requirements of external evaluation exercises such as the Research Excellence Framework (REF). It also provides an effective means of promoting and disseminating the institution's research activity to the wider world.

## CRIS / RIMS structure

Typically a CRIS / RIMS will contain modules for the following:

* Researcher profiles
* Grant applications / awards
* Publications
* Supporting information on research impact / research environment

Additional information such as teaching responsibilities may also be included.

### Architecture

The data structure of CRIS / RIMS is based on the set of basic entities defined by the Common European Research Information Format (CERIF) maintained by EuroCRIS (the international organisation for research information).

The basic CERIF entities are people, organisations, projects and outputs.

A fundamental underpinning of CRIS / RIMS systems is interoperability and bilateral data exchange with third party internal systems including but not limited to human resources systems, finance systems and institutional repositories. Similarly metadata needs to be seamlessly exchanged with third party external systems such as those of funders and the REF.

### CRIS / RIMS in the UK

A full list of CRIS / RIMS products available in the UK is included in our [product directory](https://helibtech.netlify.app/product-directory/)[ ](https://helibtech.netlify.app/product-directory/)and an overview of the current  CRIS / RIMS market is included in the market overview section under this topic.

The UK market however is dominated by Elsevier's Pure and Symplectic Elements, with smaller market shares for Converis and Worktribe.

It is worth noting that less than 50% of UK HEIs are users of CRIS / RIMS systems currently. However, use is almost universal amongst research intensive institutions such as those of the Russell Group.
