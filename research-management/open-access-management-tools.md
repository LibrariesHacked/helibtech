# Open access management tools

Academic libraries play a central role in supporting and
managing their institution’s research outputs. As well as curating research
outputs via Institutional Repositories, libraries increasingly play a critical
role in managing institution’s Open Access (OA). 

The role of libraries in supporting Open Access has grown considerably over the past 5 years in light of the Open Access obligations of the Research Excellence Framework and major research funders such as UKRI, The Wellcome Trust and Horizon Europe.

Libraries are therefore often responsible for the following:

* Hosting OA outputs via institutional repositories (IRs)
* Ensuring compliance with funders OA mandates
* Ensuring compliance with publishers’ OA policies
* Administering OA funds -institutional budgets to cover
  article processing charges (OA)
* Administering institutional publisher transitional
  agreements (TAs) which include the ability to publish OA in “hybrid” journals*
* Reporting on OA compliance for the Research Excellence
  Framework

Libraries will use a variety of tools to manage the OA workflow, OA policies and OA monitoring / reporting.

Below you will find details of some of the main tools currently used.

\*Hybrid journals are priced publisher journals that allow a proportion of articles to be made available Open Access

### Institutional Repositories (IRs)

Used to store and provide Open Access to scholarly outputs. The IR workflow will typically include elements of OA administration for research outputs such as setting of publisher embargos (for Green Open Access) and ensuring metadata meets publisher requirements (e.g. by the use of set publisher attribution statements).

### APC Management and Open Access Funds

Libraries often manage Article Processing Charge (APC) funds and agreements.

* [ChronosHub](https://chronoshub.io/about-us/about-us/) – Supports APC workflows, funding compliance, and publisher agreements.
* [RightsLink for Scientific Communications](https://www.copyright.com/solutions-rightslink-scientific-communications/) – this service from the Copyright Clearance Center provides workflows for APC administration and management.

In addition, individual publishers will use dashboards for managing transitional agreements which are often administered by libraries e.g. the Wiley Open Access Dashboard (WOAD) and the[ Taylor & Francis Research Dashboard](https://librarianresources.taylorandfrancis.com/open-research/choose-open-access/research-dashboard/)


### Where to Publish

Libraries will frequently provide advice and guidance to researchers on best practice for making their work available Open Access and will use tools such as:
[](https://doaj.org/)

* [Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)](https://doaj.org/) is a unique and extensive index of diverse open access journals
   from around the world.
* [ Think, Check, Submit](https://thinkchecksubmit.org/) can help researchers identify trusted journals for their research.


### Metadata, Discoverability, and Compliance Tools

There are a range of tools that help ensure Open Access outputs are discoverable and compliant with publisher mandates:

* [OA Switchboard](https://www.oaswitchboard.org/about) allows the sharing of information between publishers, institutions and funders. This includes publication metadata and alerts to OA articles published by institutions’ authors.
* [Open Policy Finder](https://openpolicyfinder.jisc.ac.uk/) (formerly Sherpa-Romeo) - an online resource that aggregates and analyses publisher open access policies from around the world and provides summaries of publisher copyright and open access archiving policies on a journal-by-journal basis.
* [ROARMAP](https://roarmap.eprints.org/) is an international registry of Open Access mandates and policies (adopted by universities, research institutions and research funders) that require or request their researchers to provide Open Access to their peer-reviewed research article output by depositing it in an Open Access repository.
* [Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org/) – API or browser extension used to locate OA versions of papers.
* [CORE](https://core.ac.uk/) – Aggregates Open Access research outputs from repositories and journals globally.


### Persistent Identifiers

Persistent identifiers support the tracking, attribution and identification of outputs and authors:

* [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) – a free unique persistent identifier (PID) for individual researchers to use to aid discovery and attribution of their work..
* [DOI](https://www.doi.org/)**–** Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) are a unique, persistent string of characters used to permanently identify a piece of digital content, such as a journal article or research paper. It acts as a stable, permanent link to the online resource, unlike a URL which may change or disappear over time. Typically publishers will assign a DOI on publication. However services CrossRef and DataCite offer DOI registration services which may be useful to researchers seeking to make their work Open Access via alternative publishing routes.
