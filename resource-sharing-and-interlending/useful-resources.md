# Resource sharing and interlending: useful resources

Below is a collection of useful reports, websites, blogposts etc. relevant to different aspects of resource sharing and interlending:

[Library Lending Fit for the 21st Century? Controlled Digital Lending in the UK ](https://www.rluk.ac.uk/library-lending-fit-for-the-21st-century-controlled-digital-lending-in-the-uk/)David Prosser. RLUK blog. 27 September 2021

From the blog: “Over the past few decades, a growing proportion of materials purchased by libraries has been in electronic rather than physical format. This format shift has brought many changes in the way in which we make materials available, and archive and preserve them. We have also moved in many areas from owning materials to leasing or renting them. However, nothing in these shifts affect the fundamental principle that libraries should be able to lend the materials that they have acquired to the communities they serve.”

[Implementing Controlled Digital Lending (CDL) Responsibly and Effectively: A Primer for Librarians.](https://page.exlibrisgroup.com/hubfs/HQ_General/Ex%20Libris%20Controlled%20Digital%20Lending%20White%20Paper.pdf?hsLang=en)

Ex Libris \[White Paper] 2021

“Making copies of print materials available to patrons in digital format brings many advantages. For instance, this practice can make collections more widely accessible to researchers and the general public, as seen during the pandemic. There are also economic and ecological benefits to digital lending. Yet, libraries must ensure they are not violating copyright restrictions when circulating digital copies of their physical materials. To help librarians navigate this challenge, a concept known as Controlled Digital Lending (CDL) has emerged. This paper explains what CDL is, how it supports the library’s mission, and how librarians can implement CDL successfully at their institutions.”
