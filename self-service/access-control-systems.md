## Access Control Systems

Many but by no means all higher education libraries restrict access to designated users by means of gated entry with ID cards. As such passing through some form of security gates on entry is a common experience for staff, students and visitors.

Libraries are using a variety of technologies to manage access control into their spaces. More information on the current market share can be found in the [SCONUL Library Technology Survey](https://www.sconul.ac.uk/services-for-members/technology-survey/).

### General access control systems

Many libraries are using general proprietary access control systems to provide gated access to their spaces. In many cases this will be using similar access control software / hardware to other restricted spaces on campuses.

Examples of such systems include:

[Gunnebo Entrance Control](https://www.gunneboentrancecontrol.com/en_us/products/)

[Cardax (Gallagher Security)](https://products.security.gallagher.com/security/global/en/)

[Salto Systems](https://saltosystems.com/en-gb/)

Typically users' cards will be programmed with an access profile determining access to varying spaces across campuses. Providers such as the above may provide gated entry via swipe card access as well as other access restrictions such as swipe locks to individual rooms / areas.

Typically systems such as the above will run their own proprietary software to both manage access profiles and provide data on users' access to spaces.

### Library specific access control systems

Providers of other library self-service hardware are increasingly providing access control systems to complement their other products as part of a wider library self-service offering. These will typically offer as standard integration with other library solutions such as library management systems.

[Advanova ](https://advanova.co.uk/products/access-control/)

[](https://advanova.co.uk/products/access-control/)Advanova (formerly Telepen) has long provided access control via their Sentry security gates.

[Bibliotecha](https://www.bibliotheca.com/en-gb/solutions/extended-access/)[](https://www.bibliotheca.com/en-gb/solutions/extended-access/)
Bibliotecha have introduced their Extended Access system which provides secure access to either entire libraries or designated spaces and integration with their broader self service offering.

[Lynsgoe Systems](https://lyngsoesystems.com/library/self-service-equipment/self-operated-library)
Similary Lynsgoe also now offer their Lynsgoe Self-Operated Library solution which in addition to providing access to spaces offers integration with self service units, security gates, reservation lockers etc.
