# Self service

This section covers hardware and software used to facilitate end-user self-service in libraries.

Primarily this consists of radio frequency identification (RFID) for library self-issue and return (and associated processes such as stock maintenance and security). However, increasingly libraries are using self-service technology (often integrated with library management systems) for issuing a range of equipment e.g. laptop loans.
