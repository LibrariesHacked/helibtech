[](https://meescan.com/products/rfid-stations/)Whilst there is currently incomplete data on UK marketshare for library RFID products, based on a sample survey of some 40 UK HEIs, the market as of 2024 is dominated by Lynsgoe Systems, closely followed by Bibliotecha.

Of institutions sampled, over a third were using a mixed economy of hardware supplied by more than one supplier. [](https://meescan.com/products/rfid-stations/)
