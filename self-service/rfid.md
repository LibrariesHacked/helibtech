# RFID and Libraries

The advantage of radio frequency identification (RFID) over other self service technologies used in libraries is usually seen to be its ability to combine the functions of the barcode (as a unique item identifier) and the security tag (able to indicate that an item is being removed from the library without permission), but with the added advantage of not needing line of sight. The customer-friendly self service that this combination of features makes possible is at the heart of the attraction of RFID for most libraries. Indeed the term ‘RFID’ has become a shorthand for self-service.

## The contrasts between RFID as used in retail and RFID in the library

RFID and some suppliers came from the retail supply chain – a very different market to libraries . In the fast moving world of RFID, solutions appear and disappear rapidly. New tag technologies appear all the time making old ones obsolete. In retail such rapid change is welcomed. In a market where the priorities are speed of supply, greater accuracy and better margins data standards are practically non-existent and tags – and tag data – change almost as fast as the applications that use them. These solutions are not designed to be used by anyone else, Asda don’t share their RFID warehousing solutions with Tesco. So the solutions are “closed loop” – i.e. they are designed to work in a closed environment to perform a particular task. In the library world RFID tag remain in item for years and may outlast the equipment originally purchased to read them.

Indeed many, libraries will used a mixed economy of RFID hardware from different suppliers.

## RFID products

More information on the RFID products available from different suppliers is included in our [product directory](/product-directory/)

Typically libraries may use one or more RFID hardware solutions:

##### Self check-out (and return)

Using RFID tags to issue and return multiple items simultaneously along with ancilliary functions such as accessing library accounts, paying fines etc.

##### RFID book sorter

Self-return hardware based on feeding items through a hatch and then sorting into multiple bins e.g. for different sections of the classification system and exceptions (for transit to other libraries / reservations)

##### Security gates

For preventing users leaving the library with un-issued stock. If items are not issued, the RFID tag in the item will trigger an audible / visual alarm on gates.

##### Digital library assistant (RFID wand)

Programmable hand held device using RFID to assist in stock maintenance activities such as shelf-checking (ensuring stock is in sequence and / or identifying missing stock by identifying all items within the programmed list that are on shelves) and stock weeding (identifying all items on shelves to be weeded according to a programmed list).

##### Staff workstation

Tagging plate for programming RFID tags by syncing with item barcodes. Also to facilitate manual issue of items via RFID.

In addition suppliers now offer a range of additional RFID products to enhance the library offering. These include:

- RFID reservation self-service - to allow end users to self-issue reservations
- RFID book vending - self-service access to book "vending" machines for limited collections.

## Implementation, lifecycle and costs

RFID hardware constitutes a significant capital expenditure for libraries, which depending on products purchased may amount to an initial outlay of five figure sums or more.

When purchasing RFID products, it is important to consider whole life costs as well as initial capital outlay. RFID products will usually be subject to annual maintenance agreements, the costs of which can vary significantly between suppliers. Some suppliers may also cease to support products at end of lifecycle which can lead to vulnerabilities in terms of equipment failure or the need for further capital expenditure.

## Self-service usage rates - case studies 2018

In 2018, Ken Chad Consulting gathered case studies of self-service usage rates from a number of libraries:

#### Library 1 (Academic)

Averages fairly consistent usage rates of 80%. Still offer staffed desks and a proportion of customers will always:

- prefer to transact with a human being
- have a problem with their account
- struggle with the technology
- be picking up some sort of enclosure item where usage is supervised or an inter-library loan

"I don’t feel that people should HAVE to use it if they prefer not to. Obviously at times (for example overnight opening when there are only security-type staff available) they have to if they want to borrow/return. I’d rather offer them a choice.”

#### Library 2 (Academic)

Average in the region of 84% of issues and about 70% of returns via self-service.

#### Library 3 (Academic)

Loans and discharges since April 2017, when new system went live: 75.6% of total loans, which include the exceptions below.

- Item-based exceptions due to items that cannot be processed through the self-issue terminals
- Items belonging to other branches that do not have RFID capability
- Interlibrary loans from other libraries
- Multimedia items not RFID tagged
- Postal loans

#### Library 4 (Academic)

92% for 16/17, and 95% thus far for 17/18.

#### Library 5 (Public Library)

Target of 90% of all issues for self service kiosks. 87% satisfaction during year of response. Some types of transactions that are excluded from the stats for operational reasons but they are generally low volume.

#### Library 6 (Academic)

The library is 24/7/365 access and institution is a single faculty, independent university. Apart from the occasional item that needs to be issued manually in order to override the prescribed loan periods, near 100% RFID issues and returns as RFID self-service is the only method on offer due to lack of staffed desk. This is a small institution of circa 250 students.
