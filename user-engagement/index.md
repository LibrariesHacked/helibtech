# User engagement

This section of HELibTech covers the various technology that libraries are using to actively engage with their users.

Many Higher Education Libraries now use technology and software solutions to:

- Log and record user enquiries
- Answer enquiries from users
- Provide information literacy support through guides for resources and information seeking / management topics
- Manage user communications
- Manage users physical use of library space e.g. through room bookings

In an environment where there is a general expectation for users to communicate with services online, many HE libraries will operate some form of live chat "ask a librarian" service at minimum.

Similarly, as HE libraries have purchased more and more online resources, online user guides have become a base expectation. As the online resource environment has grown (and arguably the functionality of online platforms has become more straight forward less distinct over time), many libraries will now provide topic related online guides in addition to resource specific ones.
