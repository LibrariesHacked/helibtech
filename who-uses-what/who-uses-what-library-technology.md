### Missing data

If your institution's information is incorrect or missing please complete our [updates form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfIjk1ECrL4IMTzSUGQ8C6QSCE79j9RQmQsuIiEE04yN-MHgQ/viewform) and we will amend the data in the table.

For details of which research systems are used by which institutions (e.g. institutional repositories, CRIS systems, RDM systems) please go to the research management pages.

HELibTech is currently compiling data on institutional use of archives and special collections management systems. If you are a user of such systems please tell us more about your use of systems by completing the[ updates form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfw8F_kyteM3i1ohJlKqyxhbLv60sOaIpMeBWnQpLBK8rFx3A/viewform)

### Comparative analysis

In order to undertake more detailed and comparative analysis of institutional data you can access our [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rT5fbeJ72IWAbe58ywzK2D7zsMqLjSTIzFN_HWH7sDc/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

Use the Google Sheet for queries such as:

* Which institutions use a particular library management system
* Which institutions use particular product combinations e.g. **x** LMS with **y** discovery solution

You can also export the data in Excel by clicking the button at the top of the table to make a local copy for analysis.
