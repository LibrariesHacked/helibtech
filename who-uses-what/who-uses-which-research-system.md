# Who uses which research system?

Here you will find details of which research systems are used by different institutions across UKHE.

Click on institution name below in order to see information on an institutionâ€™s:

### Missing data

If your institution's information is incorrect or missing [](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfIjk1ECrL4IMTzSUGQ8C6QSCE79j9RQmQsuIiEE04yN-MHgQ/viewform)please complete our [updates form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSerR7YUST6iTLUd8hN2dRkzP68JeURPWQmodOQtQrv8oYL9Hw/viewform) and we will amend the data in the table.

### Comparative analysis

In order to undertake more detailed and comparative analysis of institutional data you can access our [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17WfzF_7dapuNRyUn0fw4tfxkPWhEZmn0aj7GJQAFcPM/edit?gid=0#gid=0)[](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rT5fbeJ72IWAbe58ywzK2D7zsMqLjSTIzFN_HWH7sDc/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

Use the Google Sheet for queries such as:

* Which institutions use a repository product
* Which institutions use particular product combinations e.g. **x** CRIS / RIMS with **y** institutional repository

You can also export the data in Excel by clicking the button at the top of the table to make a local copy for analysis.
